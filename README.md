## Installation

[arcdps](https://www.deltaconnected.com/arcdps/) and the [unofficial extras plugin](https://github.com/Krappa322/arcdps_unofficial_extras_releases) should be installed.

Download the [latest release from the Releases page](https://github.com/Krappa322/arcdps_unofficial_extras_releases/releases/latest).

Place the .dll file into the same folder as arcdps.

## Usage

The plugin will play sounds when a ready check has started, and when the ready check has completed and the squad is ready.

By default, the sounds are English text-to-speech of the phrases "Ready check" and "Squad ready".

To setup custom sounds and volume levels, you can open the arcdps options panel (Alt+Shift+T by default) and adjust the volume levels for each event, and you can also provide a path to a MP3, WAV, or FLAC file to customize the sound.
